Reasearch Questions API (Improvement)
- Outline critical campaign question which will be covered by the API
	- General Trends
		- What is most talked about (regardless of area or topic)
			- Topic Modeller to extract topics
				- GENSIM
			- Use extracted topics to label data
			- Count the most occurent topics
		- What is the sentiment towards what is being discussed?
			- Filter the dataset by occurent topics as well as sentiment.
	- Politicians' Reputation (Reasearch Questions about the Candidates/Politicians)
		- Who is most talked about?
			- Count using already created list of politicians
		- What questions are being asked about this candidate?
			- Try Topic Modeller to extract topics from filtered tweets
			- Try Getting most common words from tokenized words after removing stop words.
			- Try getting most common  sentence structure components (NounPhrase, Object etc) from tweets.
		- Popularity or notoreity of the most talked about.
			- Sentiment after filtering by most occuring candidate.
		- Most popular, and most notorious candidates/politician.
			- Candidate with highest positive sentiment
			- Candidate with highest negative sentiment
		- How much is a certain candidate being talked about?
			- Count after filtering by any candidate.
		- What is being said about each candidate?
			- Try Topic Modeller to extract topics from filtered tweets
			- Try Getting most common words from tokenized words after removing stop words.
			- Try getting most common  sentence structure components (NounPhrase, Object etc) from tweets.
		- What is the general sentiment of what is being said about ?
			- Label each row after filtering by candidate with extracted topics and check sentiment.
	- Citizens' Sentiment (Research Question about the Citizens)
		- What is the general sentiment of the citizens?
			-Count most occurent sentiment
	- Discourse Areas (Research Question about the Citizens Complaints)
		- What are the various areas of complaints as regards to governance?
			Manually labelled categories for tweets.
			- Infrastructure
			- Education
			- Health
			- Security
			- Policies
			- Economic Indicators (e.g. inflation, exchange rate, trade balance)
			- Unrelated
		- What is most discussed(election and governance related)?
			- Count Tweets after filtering by area of discourse.
		- Specific elements of discussion for the different areas.
			- Filter by already labelled discourse areas
			- Tokenize the Dataset
			- Remove stop words
			- Use Frequency Distribution to get most common words
			- Build Word cloud using most common words.
		- What are the levels of sentiment towards the various area of complaints?
			- Count Tweets after filtering by both sentiment and area of discourse.
			
	- These research questions can be narrowed down from national level, to state level, as well as local government level.
	- These same architecture can be scaled and adjusted to any nation and economy.
- Answer these question using analytical methods and ML algorithms and make these answers available at endpoints for future analysts.

- Tables will be created to hold this information (precalculated in an automated script), to save response time for the API

- Step by step Approach
	- One research area section is selected and build upon for integration and deployment. - Done
		- Dataset will be labelled manually for training.
		- Each different aspect of our research questions will be label separately for training.
	- Elaborate explanations are outlined on how to execute the same methods on the different regions, in future phases. - Done
	- Categories for our manual labelling
		- Sentiment
			- Positive
			- Indifferent
			- Negative
		- Discourse Areas
			- Infrastructure
			- Education
			- Health
			- Security
			- Policies
			- Economic Indicators (e.g. inflation, exchange rate, trade balance)
			- Unrelated
	- Use BERT to encode word and sentences, pad for same length, feed into CNN for prediction.
	- Use GENSIM for Topic Modelling.


Dashboard Creation
- PowerBi connection to the hosted database to visualize the information answered in the research questions section, as well the general data and display this visuals on a dashboard which will be published for non-technical persons.


Election Database (Improvement)
- Email notification after every scheduled database update
	- Containing
		- Execution logs
		- Quantity added, Quantity removed
		- Prevent data corruption from bots, by removing duplicate tweets.


Election Campaign TPL (Improvement)
- This section will reflect whichever changes made in the API.


UI/UX
- Detailed Conceptual of the UI/UX of the entire platform, which obviously include the "citizens' voice".
