	- These research questions can be narrowed down from national level, to state level, as well as local government level.
	- These same architecture can be scaled and adjusted to any nation and economy.
- Answer these question using analytical methods and ML algorithms and make these answers available at endpoints for future analysts.

- Tables will be created to hold this information (precalculated in an automated script), to save response time for the API

- Step by step Approach
	- One research area section is selected and build upon for integration and deployment. - Done
		- Dataset will be labelled manually for training. - Ongoing
	- Elaborate explanations are outlined on how to execute the same methods on the different regions, in future phases. - Done
	- Categories for our manual labelling - Ongoing
		- Sentiment
			- Positive
			- Indifferent
			- Negative
		- Discourse Areas
			- Infrastructure
			- Education
			- Health
			- Security
			- Policies
			- Economic Indicators (e.g. inflation, exchange rate, trade balance)
			- Unrelated
		- Allocation for ranges for manual labelling.
			- Michael: 0 - 10,000
			- Abiye: 10:001 - 20,000
			- Chineye: 20,001 - 30,000
			- Stephen: 30,001 - 40,000

	- After the new set of data from the database has been cleaned (Abiye), and appended to the old data. This cleaned column of the dataset will remove also the tweeter handles in order not to bias the predictive model.
	- Predict positive and negative sentiment.
	- Predict dicourse area.
	- These predicted labels will be attached to the new extracted dataset.
		- General Trends
			- Use GENSIM for Topic Modelling to extract most popular trends (like first 5), by region (Nigeria first, then the states filtering by location)
			- Create a General Trends table with columns (Region, Most popular trend, second trend, third trend, positive sentiment count, negative sentiment count).
				- The rows of the Region columns will be Nigeria, and the 36 states.
				- The rows of the trends columns will be the topics extracted for the entire dataset, and for the filtered dataset by each state using the GENSIM topic modeler.
				- The rows of sentiment columns will be the count of each of the sentiments.

		- Politician's Reputation
			- Use GENSIM to extract the most popular trends, after filtering py politicians name using the filter function for public office holders (Abiye)
			- Create 37 table (Nigeria and the 36 states)
			- Each table will have the columns (Public Office Holder, Most popular trend, second trend, third trend, positive sentiment count, negative sentiment count).
				- The rows of the first column will be the list of public office holders.
				- The rows of the trends columns will be the topics extracted for the entire dataset, and for the filtered dataset by the state corresponding to the table name using the GENSIM topic modeler, after having filter per public office holder.
				- The rows of sentiment columns will be the count of each of the sentiments, after filtering by public office holder and by state.
			- Questions like 'most popular or notorious public office holder' will be answered by checking the public office holder with the highest count for positive or negative sentiment.

		- Citizen's Sentiment/Complaint 
			- Use GENSIM for Topic Modelling to extract most popular trends (like first 5), by region (Nigeria first, then the states filtering by location), after having filtered by each of the categories in our discourse area label.
			- Create a table for each discourse area with columns (Region, Most popular trend, second trend, third trend, positive sentiment count, negative sentiment count).
				- The rows of the Region columns will be Nigeria, and the 36 states.
				- The rows of the trends columns will be the topics extracted for the entire dataset, and for the filtered dataset by each discourse area using the GENSIM topic modeler.
				- The rows of sentiment columns will be the count of each of the sentiments, after applying the respective filters.

		- Methods of Sentiment Analysis
				- Bag of Words Approach, combined with Naive Bayes, LDA, QDA, Weighted KNN or Deep NN
				- Word2Vec or My Personal Encoder, combined with EncoderRecurrent Neural Netword/LSTM

Dashboard Creation
- PowerBi connection to the hosted database to visualize the information answered in the research questions section, as well the general data and display this visuals on a dashboard which will be published for non-technical persons.


Election Database (Improvement) -Done
- Email notification after every scheduled database update
	- Containing
		- Execution logs
		- Quantity added, Quantity removed
		- Prevent data corruption from bots, by removing duplicate tweets.
